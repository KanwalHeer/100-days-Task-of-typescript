* Reading Artical of 10 points for enhancing programming skills ,i summarized this Artical in 10 short points here are these points;

1-Practice, Practice, Practice...: Apply theoretical knowledge practically by practicing coding questions regularly. This helps in gaining familiarity with syntax, developing problem-solving skills, and understanding common programming problems.

2-Consistency in Learning: Avoid irregular learning patterns and maintain consistency in practicing programming every day to enhance problem-solving skills and tackle new challenges effectively.

3-Avoid Overanalysis: Don't spend too much time overanalyzing concepts. Understand topics in a simple way, use them practically, and move forward. Save in-depth analysis for later when you have more experience.

4-Read Error Messages Carefully: Pay attention to error messages displayed on the screen while coding. They provide valuable information about issues and can help you find solutions if you read them carefully.

5-Solve MCQs Questions: Practice solving multiple-choice questions (MCQs) to improve syntax knowledge, understand programming rules, and analyze program behavior in different scenarios.

6-Code With Hands: Use pen and paper while coding, especially as a beginner, to process information faster and enhance technical skills. It also prepares you for coding tasks during interviews.

7-Read Other People's Code: Read and analyze code written by others to learn new techniques, find solutions to tough problems, and improve coding skills.

8-Enhance Problem-Solving Skills: Constantly work on enhancing problem-solving skills, a crucial skill for developers. Don't get discouraged by errors; instead, learn from them and continue the learning process.

9-Divide Tasks into Smaller Parts: Break down programming tasks into smaller parts to manage time effectively and ensure completion without mistakes. Start with basics and progress gradually to higher levels.

10-Find a Perfect Mentor: Seek guidance from a knowledgeable mentor who can provide direction, explain concepts, and help solve problems. Engage with communities and participate in competitions to accelerate learning and growth.

These summarized points highlight essential tips for beginners to learn programming effectively and efficiently.
